Experience
================

PhD Student :: TU Delft :: Sep 2014 - August 2018 (expected)
-------



My research consists in the development of scalable manifold-learning algorithms for the analysis of extremely large high-dimensional data, such as medical datasets, social-networks and deep neural networks.
My algorithms and systems were presented in the most important visual analytics venues and are used by medical researchers for the analysis of real-world data.
Thanks to the [Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE)][9] algorithm that I developed, we were able to identify previously unknown immune-system cell types.
This result was achieved by scaling up the number of cells that could be analyzed with a manifold-learning algorithm from a few thousands to several millions.
[HSNE][9] is also the cornerstone for [DeepEyes][10], a system for the visual analysis of deep neural networks during training that I developed.
My algorithms are implemented in a C++ library that will be released later this year.

Visiting PhD Student :: INRIA/AVIZ :: April 2017 - June 2017
-------

Software Engineer :: Open Technologies S.R.L. :: July 2011 - Aug 2014
-------
I was responsible of the development of the high-end real-time scanner [Insight3][5]
I optimized the algorithms developed during my Research Fellowship and developed several [Arduino][6]-based systems for the on-board control of [Insight3][5].
Furthermore, I contributed to the development of the computational-geometry module of the [Open Technologies S.R.L.][1] proprietary library and I was in charge of the control versioning and the release of the company's main software.

Research Fellow :: University of Brescia :: Oct 2011 - Oct 2012
-------
I developed proprietary algorithms for the real-time computation of implicit surfaces on the GPU.
These algorithms are designed to work with {off-the-shelf} and real-time scanning devices like the [Microsoft Kinect][2] and the [PrimeSense Carmine/Capri][3].
Furthermore, I devised a proprietary passive stereo system that led to the development of the [Insight3][5] high-quality real-time scanner.
Due to the strict real-time requirements all the developed algorithms were implemented in C++, CUDA and Thrust.

Master Thesis :: Open Technologies S.R.L. :: Mar 2011 - Jul 2011
-------
During my master thesis I worked on the development of fast and automatic tools for the alignment of 3D data such as point clouds, meshes and range images.
This work was done in collaboration with the company [Open Technologies S.R.L.][1]
I graduated with a final grade of 110/110.

Bachelor Thesis :: G2L S.R.L. :: Mar 2008 - Jul 2008
-------
During my bachelor thesis I developed a library for interprocess communication between real-time applications working in [Linux-Xenomai][7] and other Linux applications.
This work was done in collaboration with the company [G2L S.R.L.][8]
