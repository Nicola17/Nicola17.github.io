Experience
================

PhD Student :: TU Delft :: Sep 2014 - Present
-------
I'm a PhD student in the [Computer Graphics & Visualization](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/) group at the Delft University of Technology.
I'm supervised by [Prof. Anna Vilanova](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/anna-vilanova/), my Promotor (doctoral advisor) is [Prof. Elmar Eisemann](http://graphics.tudelft.nl/~eisemann/) and [Prof. Boudewijn P.F. Lelieveldt](https://www.lumc.nl/org/radiologie/medewerkers/1008040000252222) is my co-Promotor.
My research interest is mainly oriented towards the application of Machine Learning algorithms, in particular Manifold Learning and Deep Learning, in a Visual Analytics context.

R&D Engineer :: Open Technologies S.R.L. :: Oct 2012 - Aug 2014
-------
During these two years I worked in extending my research results into products for Open Technologies S.R.L.
I was in charge of prototyping the [Insight3][5] high-quality real time scanner which was released as a product at the beginning of 2014.
To this end, I developed several [Arduino][6]-based systems for the on-board control of the 3D scanner.
Furthermore, I worked on the development of the computational geometry aspect of the [Open Technologies S.R.L.][1] proprietary library.


Research Fellow :: University of Brescia :: Oct 2011 - Oct 2012
-------
My research fellowship at the University of Brescia was funded by [Open Technologies S.R.L.][1]
During this year I developed proprietary algorithms for the real-time computation of implicit surfaces.
These algorithms are designed to work with of the shelf real-time scanning devices like the [Microsoft Kinect][2] and the [PrimeSense Carmine/Capri][3] making use of the [OpenNI][4] toolkit.
Furthermore, I started the development of a proprietary passive stereo system that led to the creation of the [Insight3][5] high-quality real-time scanner.

R&D Engineer :: Open Technologies S.R.L. :: Jul 2011 - Oct 2011
-------
I implemented the algorithms presented in my master thesis in the [Open Technologies][1] software library.
These improvements were integrated in the upcoming release of [Open Technologies][1]'s software, Optical RevEng 2.0.

Master Thesis :: Open Technologies S.R.L. :: Mar 2011 - Jul 2011
-------
During my master thesis I worked on the development of fast and automatic tools for the alignment of 3D data, e.g., point clouds, meshes and range images.
This work was done in collaboration with [Open Technologies S.R.L.][1]
The final grade is 110/110.

Bachelor Thesis :: G2L S.R.L. :: Mar 2008 - Jul 2008
-------
During my bachelor thesis I developed a library for the interprocess communication between real-time applications working in [Linux-Xenomai][7] and other Linux applications.
This work was done in collaboration with [G2L S.R.L.][8]
