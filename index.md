About me
=======================


I am a Research Scientist focusing on the development of algorithmic solutions for Artificial-Intelligence and Visual-Analytics. My algorithms and tools are used in several research groups and led to discoveries presented in important venues such as "Nature Communications", "Nature Immunology" and the "Journal of Experimental Medicine".
I do not focus only on fundamental research, but also on the development of large, scalable and stable software and its path to useful products.

After my master, I worked for more than three years in an [Italian start-up](https://www.opentechnologies.it/en/home-2/) developing 3D scanners, now acquired by [FARO](https://www.faro.com), as research & development engineer and as research fellow at the [University of Brescia](https://en.unibs.it/).
I received my PhD Cum Laude from [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the [Computer Graphics & Visualization](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/) group, in close collaboration with the [Division of Image-Processing](https://www.lumc.nl/org/radiologie/research/LKEB/) at [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/).
During the PhD I joined [INRIA Saclay](https://aviz.fr/) as Visiting Scientist, and I worked at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) with Alexander Mordvintsev, the creator of Google's DeepDream. At Google, I published two research papers and developed an open source library released in the [TensorFlow.js family](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-tsne).
I currently work at [Philips Research](https://www.philips.com/content/corporate/en_AA/research/home.html/), focusing on the development of reliable and human-centered Artificial-Intelligence solutions for healthcare.
