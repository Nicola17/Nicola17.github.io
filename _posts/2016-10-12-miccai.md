Renata G. Raidou will present her work *"Employing Visual Analytics to Aid the Design of
White Matter Hyperintensity Classifiers"* at [MICCAI][1] next week.
I had the pleasure to make a small contribution in Renata's work, and I believe that it confirms how the TU Delft CG&V group is leader in the development of Visual Analytics systems that employ non-linear dimensionality-reduction techniques.

This is the poster that you will find at MICCAI:
