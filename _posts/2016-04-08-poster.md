[Delft Data Science][1] is TU Delftâ€™s framework initiative for research activities in data science.
Yesterday the seminar **Data Science and Sports** was held at the TU with the goal of rising awareness about the advantages of combining data science and sport.

*Data and sports are an exciting combination. Can performance be improved by using available data? Can new types of data be gathered that will yield novel insights in performance? How can measured data be visualized to be optimally usable for supporting staff?  Which data related questions are urgent in various disciplines in sports?*

At the event we presented the following poster where we showed our contributions in the analysis of *inertial measurement unit* readings using dimensionality reduction techniques.
