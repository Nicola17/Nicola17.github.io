Finally, after some struggle, we managed to have our work published in a Visual Analytics venue.
Our paper **Approximated and User Steerable tSNE for Progressive Visual Analytics** was initially submitted to IEEE VIS 2015, where it got rejected.
The paper will be published soon on the **IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics** journal, and we are also invited to present it at **IEEE VIS 2016**.

We also continued our work on dimensionality reduction in a visual analytics context. A new algorithm named **Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSNE)** will be presented a **EuroVis 2016**.
This algorithm allows for a hierarchical analysis of large high-dimensional dataset, providing with the ability to scale the analysis in a completely new way.

At **EuroVis 2016**, [Thomas HÃ¶llt](http://www.thomashollt.com/) will also present **Cytosplore: Interactive Immune Cell Phenotyping for Large Single-Cell Datasets.**. In this work, our Approximated-tSNE is used in an integrated system for the definition and identification of known and unknown cell types from mass cytometry data.

See you at **EuroVis 2016** and **IEEE VIS 2016**.
